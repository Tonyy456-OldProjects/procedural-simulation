Procedural Simulation is a work in progress Unity Application. We have the following goals
- Minecraft like clone.
- Complex Evolution like a predator and prey simulations with more parameters.
- Procedural Animations for the player and the creatures.
- World Generation
- Artificial Intelligence Applications. Neural Networks.
